                 <h2>Background</h2>
                 <p>
The Superhuman Sports Design Challenge is an international symposium celebrating the next generation of inventors. It is run by the International <a href="http://superhuman-sports.org">Superhuman Sports Society</a>.  </p>

		 <p>Superhuman Sports aims to create a field where people can compete overcoming limitations with technology. The focus is on improving cognitive and physical functions of the human body, creating artificial senses and reflexes to participate in sports competitions: creating and exploring new experiences with these novel senses and reflexes by augmenting old sports, designing new sports, enhancing the training, and sharing with the audience locally and remotely.  
</p>
 <p>
The symposium focuses on designing and inventing novel superhuman sports or augmenting existing sport games. Superhuman Sports are activities that
<ol>
  <li> <p> rely on technology for human augmentation to enhance a human ability, </p></li>
  <li>  <p> involve physical fitness and skills and</p></li>
  <li>  <p> are played for fun, competition or health reasons.</p></li>
    </ol>
</p>

                  <h2>Objectives and Requirements</h2>
                  <p>
		     The focus of the symposium is on demonstrating superhuman sports that enhance human capabilities, augment senses and merge realities. Participants are to design a superhuman sport that requires physical exertion and skills. The superhuman sport needs to require some sort of social interaction. For that purpose, an individual or team competes against another for entertainment/fun or for improving overall health. The competition can be in real-time or delayed. The superhuman sport needs to use mixed reality, i.e. somewhere on the spectrum between augmented or virtual reality, equipment. The equipment can be wearable or on the sports field.

                              <h2>Evaluation Criteria</h2>

     <p>
There will be  a professional panel of Superhuman Sports Society Members and Designers to evaluate each demonstrated superhuman sport. In addition there will be an audience price comprised by voting of players and  spectators. Demonstrated superhuman sports will be evaluated in terms of: 
<ul>
  <li> <p> <b>Human augmentation</b>: How and how much does the superhuman sport augment human senses and capabilities? </p></li>
  <li> <p> <b>Fitness and skills</b>: In how far does the superhuman sport require or train physical fitness and skills? </p></li>
<li> <p> <b>Fun and engagement</b>: How much fun and how engaging  is it for participants to play?  </p></li>
<li> <p> <b>Innovation</b>: How innovative is the superhuman sport?</p></li>
<li> <p> <b>Audience</b>: How much fun is it for the audience to watch the superhuman sport?</p></li>
<li> <p> <b>Inclusiveness</b>: Can participants with different background practice the superhuman sport?</p></li>
</ul>

           <h2>Constraints</h2>

            <p>
Time limit is 30 minutes for one round. During this time, all aspects of the superhuman sport need to be presented.  The rules should be simple enough that it can be explained in 5-10 minutes to people with diverse background.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
The superhuman sports needs to be able to be played indoors. The symposium will take place in the auditorium of the Delft University of Technology. This will provide ample access to technology as well as ample space for the public to attend the symposium and the demonstrations of the new superhuman sports. The superhuman sports need to be demonstrated in the area indicated by the red square in the <a href="images/floorplan_auditorium.png">floor plan</a>. The area in front of the podium in the square has a size of 16m by 14m. However, at the end towards the auditorium it is only 12m wide. The ceiling in the auditorium starts at 7m. When designing your superhuman sports, please keep these constraints in mind.
